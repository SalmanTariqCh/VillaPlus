I have created a console application to take input from the user since there is no UI involved.

After you run the application in Console, please give Yes or No option depending on your choice. 
After giving Yes option, please give the number of apples and oranges. Then please give the cost of 
one apple and one orange. After you gave the cost of apple and orange, please choose whether you
want to give the discount by writing yes or no. 

If you wish to choose the discount, please give the number of items on which you want to give 
discount. For example you give value of 3 here. Afterwards please give the number of items 
discounted. For example you give the value of 1 here. This means there is discount of 1 item if 
you buy 3. The discounted item will be deducted from those items which has maximum number. For example
if apples are 4 and oranges are 3, then 2 item will be discounted (or removed from apple's price) if 
buy 3 get one free criteria is given.

App will keep running and giving you the results till you said No at the beginning of App or this will
terminate it automatically after it reaches 100 iterations.

I have also implemented some validations which will help you running the App.
